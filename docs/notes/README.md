## Welcome to my notes

::: tip Hello Notes
Here's where I'll document what I learned so far..., so I can connect the dots later and reinforce my knowledge & memery with more OUTPUT. :monocle_face:

Since I decided to switch career from Architectural Designer to Developer back in 2019, it's been none stop learning trying to catch up. There's a lot of INPUT, not much OUTPUT, can't shake the feeling of Impostor Syndrome. So, it's time to put some condition to the tutorial hell loop and break out of it...! :sweat_smile:

```js:no-line-numbers
while (input) {
    // Tutorial Hell
    ...
    if (output) input = !input;
}
```

_P.S. Please bear with my poor writing skill!_ :wink:
